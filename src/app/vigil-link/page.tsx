        VIGIL-LINK is the secure communications backbone of the VIGIL-MD ecosystem — 
        a self-healing mesh relay network designed for rock-dense, signal-blocked environments.
        Each node autonomously connects and reroutes data, ensuring total continuity of 
        monitoring and emergency alerts even during infrastructure loss.
